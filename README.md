# Zebra [![Build Status](https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra/workflows/Build%20Zebra/badge.svg?branch=1.2&event=push)](https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush+workflow%3A%22Build+Zebra%22) [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/zebra/localized.svg)](https://translate.getzbra.com/project/zebra) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/wstyres/Zebra?color=brightgreen&label=version)](https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra/releases/latest)
Zebra (n√©e AUPM) is a Package Manager for jailbroken iOS devices. It is built to support iOS 11 up to iOS 13 and for iPhones and iPads alike.

## Installation
#### From an APT Repo
Zebra is available from Zebra's APT repo for iOS located at [https://getzbra.com/repo](https://getzbra.com/repo).

This source can be added to any package manager on your iPhone or iPad, and it is included by default with Zebra to provide future updates.

Zebra also has a beta repository that contains builds for beta testers to try out new features and report potential problems you can add Zebra's beta APT repo for iOS located at [https://getzbra.com/beta](https://getzbra.com/beta).

#### Pre-compiled debs
Pre-compiled debs are available via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra/releases) if that is your fancy.

#### Using Xcode & theos
If you want to compile Zebra yourself, you can use the following steps. A computer running macOS is _required_ and must have Xcode installed.

1. Clone this repository using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra.git`
2. `cd` into the `Zebra` folder
3. (One time only) 
    - Install `carthage` and `fakeroot` if you haven't already via `brew install carthage fakeroot`
4. Carthage is used to manage our project dependencies. `carthage bootstrap` will need to be run on first build and whenever our dependencies push updated versions.
5. Run `make do` (If you don't have `theos` already installed on your computer, follow the steps located [here](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation))
6. Done!

## Translations

Zebra supports localization, but help is needed in order to translate Zebra!

If you are familiar with a language that is not currently supported by Zebra (you can check out a list of currently supported languages on [Crowdin](https://translate.getzbra.com/)), you can help us out by translating Zebra into your language.

The easiest and preferred method is by using Crowdin.
- If you want to add support for a new language to Zebra. First, file an issue [here](https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra/issues/new?assignees=&labels=localization&template=localization-support.md&title=%5BLocalize%5D) and tell us for which language you'd like to add support. Once we add it to Crowdin, you can start translating strings at [https://translate.getzbra.com/](https://translate.getzbra.com/)
- If you want to update a language already in Zebra and correct some issues, head over to [https://translate.getzbra.com/](https://translate.getzbra.com/), select your language, and update the new translations.

If there is a language that has an inaccurate translation that is already supported by Zebra, you can head over to CrowdIn and edit the string that has an issue directly from there. It will have to be re-approved in order for inclusion in Zebra.

New strings may be added in future Zebra versions from time to time, so it is important to keep a lookout for modified strings!
